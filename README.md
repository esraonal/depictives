Corpus analysis of depictives in Turkish

This project investigates depictives in Turkish.  The corpus includes 88 literary books written by Turkish authors.  All books are tokenized and annotated using [UDPipe2](https://github.com/ufal/udpipe/tree/udpipe-2). The code can be used to look for a token or tokens based on the annotations. A more detailed description about the project will be provided soon :)
